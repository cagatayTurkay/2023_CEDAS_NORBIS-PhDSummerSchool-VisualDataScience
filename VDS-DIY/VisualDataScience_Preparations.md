**1. Python & Anaconda:** Make sure that there is a recent/latest version of Python + Jupyter Lab environment running. Any envrionment running Python 3.7 and above will suffice. 

I recommend installing the latest version of Anaconda if you haven't already: 

https://www.anaconda.com/download

And any issues, you can refer to the documentation:

https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html

**2. Data Analysis Packages:** If you install your Python environment using Anaconda, you will have many of the packages we will be needing. The following packages are key in the exercises and will be used frequently:

- pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/
- scikit-learn - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

but they come within the Anaconda installation pre-installed, so you won't need to worry.

**3. Altair:** One package that doesn't come with Anaconda is the visualisation library called Altair: 

https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html

You will need to install that within your Python setup. Check the installation guidance here, very easy if you are using Anaconda:

https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html

Make sure that you don't have any active Jupyter kernels before installation. Once installed, try one of the examples by opening up a notebook in JupyterLab:

If you can see a bar chart, you are good to go!

**4. Panel:** for some of the interactive exercises, we will experiment with a Python-based dashboarding platform called [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/index.html). You will need to install Panel as well. Again, easiest way to do this is using an Anaconda platform. Installation details here:

https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/installation.html

You can check if you have Panel working by going through this mini guideline:

https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/build_app.html

Once you see the interactive chart, you are all good to go!
