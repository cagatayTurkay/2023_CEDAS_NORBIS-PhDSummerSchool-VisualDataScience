This is a repository of material used to support the lecture and the hands-on activities as part of the **Joint CEDAS-NORBIS Summer School on data science and its biomedical applications** held in Bergen, 7 â€“ 11 August 2023 (a webpage for the event -- https://datascience2023.w.uib.no/).

The folder contains the slides for my opening lecture titled "Doing Visual Data Science Foundations, Techniques and Practice". 



This is followed by two blocks of coding-based activities and slides to get the activities going. These can be found under the folder VDS-DIY. The materials are mostly Jupyter Notebooks that make use of the Altair visualisation library https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html and for some of the interactive exercises, the code experiments with a Python-based dashboarding platform called [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/index.html).
